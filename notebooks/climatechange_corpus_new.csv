Mountain-Blacksmith7	2025-09-12	https://reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1newx69/holy_sht_for_the_first_time_ever_monsoon_winds/	This is Absolutely Massive: Monsoon Just Broke Through the Himalayas into Tibet for the First Time Ever.  Guys, I’m not kidding—this actually happened, and it’s barely getting attention.  What Went Down: A glaciologist from Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) spotted it on satellite images while researching in Ladakh. The Southwest Monsoon—blocked by the Himalayas for millennia—pushed through to Tibet in early September 2025.  Why It’s Insane: Himalayas act as a wall, trapping monsoon moisture in India (our crazy rains) while Tibet stays bone-dry. This setup’s been locked in since pre-human times.But this year: 19 Western Disturbances (vs. usual 4-6 in winter) collided with monsoon winds, shoving air 2000+ meters high (normal: 1600-1700m). Boom—moisture crossed over.  The Scary Bit:If this keeps up, India could lose monsoon rain—80% of our annual water. Zanskar got slammed: 100mm+ rain and 6 inches snow in 2 days. A 25-year researcher called it unprecedented.  Why It Matters: Climate change is rewriting global weather. South Asia’s ancient systems feeding billions? At risk. First recorded breach ever—could be one-off or new normal. Water security for 1B+ people hangs in balance.  Feels like a history-book pivot we’re living through. Mainstream media sleeping on this massive climate story? Anyone tracking it?	Document
doc_1	I can absolutely see how we won’t survive increased warming	SpectrumWoes	2025-07-28	https://reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1mb0b5i/i_can_absolutely_see_how_we_wont_survive/	I live in the Northeast, and we’ve been experiencing a ridiculously humid summer with about 3 extended heat waves so far this season. The humidity is contributing to not only extremely dangerous temps that AC won’t put a dent in, it’s causing significant localized downpours and subsequent flooding.   I’m in my mid 40s and I’m already sapped in less than an hour being outside in this humidity. Going inside makes it a little more comfortable but I can tell the AC is struggling to keep up even with an additional dehumidifier in the house.   So while it’s manageable *now*, what’s it going to be like in 20 years? I feel like it’s going to be miserable if not potentially lethal for older people. And I’m up north, not Florida or the Southwest!   I always considered my area to be a climate “haven” as it used to be way milder but not anymore. Even extreme cold places seem to have huge swings in high temps too.   Tl;dr - it’s not looking good even up north folks.	Document

Rogan completely dismissed climate change based on a complete misreading of the Washington Post [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/19/earth-temperature-global-warming-planet/) from September 2024. The article itself is based upon the [Judd et al. paper in Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk3705). The paper's *main takeaway* is that the current *speed* of warming is driven by human CO₂ emissions and is way faster than anything in the geologic record. That is what everyone should be worried about, not just the absolute temperature.	Document

In addition to avoiding the use of farmland for energy generation, solar canals offer another advantage: the water below keeps panels cooler, helping them perform more efficiently.  The installation, called Project Nexus, isn’t connected to the grid but instead powers irrigation systems for cotton, tomato, and almond crops in a district about two hours east of San Francisco.  It’s only the second project of its kind in the U.S., following a 1.3 MW system in the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona, which is now looking to scale up and eliminate its $3 million electricity bill for irrigation operations.

I think public awareness of even rainforests as carbon storage is very limited. From what I noticed, I think that the fact that ecosystems funtion as carbon sinks is just not known. Even the lack of knowledge of ecology in general is very concerning to me. How best to educate the public on ecological issues is something I think about regularly. For instance a lot of details miss from common pieces of ecological knowledge, like the whole story around honey bees. Another thing that concerns me is that the general public just don't know what services ecosystems provide to us. And what the importance of biological diversity is (I feel in science it is still quite vague how important biodiversity is, if am not mistaken). My main point of this post is to ask the question, how do we educate people in a meaningful way, that the lessons stick. Something I'd like to be proficient is for instance informing people around me. Idk I'd like to know what you people think about this.

For those out of the loop, there has recently been a reveal of a company that has ""rebred"" supposed direwolf traits into a line of grey wolves. Every article I've read has this classified as a ""de-extinction"". This is nothing like that. It's adding similar traits to an existing gene pool.   Maybe I'm a massive cynic, but this feels like science as a tool for venture capital funding rather than for its own sake.   They're not even in the same genus! Direwolves are in their own genus (*Aenocyon*) since they share a relatively small amount of genetic information with modern canids.   It's very frustrating to me that this is being simplified where no simplification is needed. It's much more accurate and understandable to say that we found some traits in wolves that make them superficially resemble direwolves.   Also I am almost sure you could do this in a small number of generations with basic selective breeding. And where is the genetic diversity coming from for this extinct species that we have a limited number of viable DNA samples from? (IMO if the answer is more grey wolf DNA, you're just making a grey wolf in a direwolf's clothing)"	Document

How do I convince him that if he wants to continue seeing wildlife he needs to preserve the biodiversity. We already have plans for maybe a 1/4 of the property to be removed of trees so that he can build a large garage/workshop which is ok to me, its his property he should be allowed to enjoy it and it's important to be able to coexist with nature in those kind of projects. What's the best way to explain how important preserving the native vegetation and landscape is to continue seeing wildlife and enjoying the property? Thanks for any tips.	Document

The pollution has spread across more than 60 kilometres of coastline, affecting key natural areas and resort zones.  Environmental experts have already recorded mass deaths of birds, fish, and cetaceans, along with contamination of beaches and coastal waters. Specialists estimate that full ecosystem recovery may take over 10 years, with economic losses for the region projected to reach tens of millions of dollars.  Despite the scale of the disaster, coverage of this tragedy in international media has been virtually nonexistent. Local volunteers and environmentalists are struggling to combat the spill’s aftermath, but they urgently require international support and pressure on authorities to expedite cleanup efforts and conduct an independent investigation. The majority of current efforts of contamination cleaning are conducted solely by volunteers, including veterinary assessment and cleaning of affected birds.   Russian government severely underestimates the scale of the tragedy, as local authorities silence volunteers and try to cover it up as much as possible from higher ups. The dedication of these volunteers deserves recognition, and the world needs to be informed about the ongoing efforts to address this tragedy.   Please help us to be heard. Spread the word.	Document

Herman_Martinus	2022-09-13	https://reddit.com/r/GreenEnergy/comments/xd1kik/question_could_solar_panels_lead_to_warming/	"Let me preface this with I think solar panels are neat, and they are a necessary part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. This isn't a post about how PV panels are ""doing more harm than good"", this is an earnest question that I have been unable to answer elsewhere.   So here goes:  The [Albedo effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo) is when the parts of the planet (think the Sahara or ice caps) reflect solar radiation back into space. If tree'd over we'd see an increase in in global temperatures as these big mirrors have a larger contribution to overall heat dispersal than forests in reducing temprature by sequestering CO2.   With this in mind, let's assume for a second that PV panels are the predominate way to generate power in the future. Let's also make the assumption that the largest solar arrays are in desert regions (where there's a lot of sunlight and land that in unsuitable for agriculture). All of this captured energy inevitably ends up as heat energy (after doing useful work) either through heating homes, smelting, or powering data centres.   Could this reduction in the reflectiveness, combined with the capturing of energy that inevitably turns into heat potentially lead to a nett warming, rather than a nett cooling effect?  I would speculate that the actual heat energy captured is negligible, but that the reduction of the reflectivity of the landmass may contribute to the albedo effect.  Anyone with knowledge in this area, I'd sincerely appreciate your input :)"	Document
